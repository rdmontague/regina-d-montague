<h1>Personal Website Project Milestone 2</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>This section will have my name and a brief and catchy line about what I want to do.  Since I am currently in a fullstack bootcamp, I have not quite learned enough to know where I would like to focus my career.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>This section will probably consist of three columns.  The first will list my professional skills and fluency in Spanish, the second will list the programming languages with which I should be familiar at the end of the bootcamp, the third might list other relevant infromation like my culinary arts degree, social media management certification, etc. This is the section that would be regularly updated as I acquire more skills.</p>
<h2>Portfolio</h2>
Ideally this will house a minimum of four to six examples of my work.
<h2>Contact</h2>
This section will contain my professional social media contacts for LinkedIn and Facebook.  It will also feature any other pertinent contact links such as my Github link and professional email address.  There will also be a contact form with a captcha to keep out the robots.
